## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke trust and security. Use a contrasting color for dark mode.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F0FF) for a clean, approachable feel. Dark grey for dark mode.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9100) for warnings, alerts, and key CTAs to grab attention. A lighter shade of orange for dark mode.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for the body and headings, to offer a modern and neutral aesthetic suitable for both light and dark modes.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent different types of phishing attacks and security concepts. Consider using icons from a consistent set, like Material Design Icons, adaptable for both light and dark themes.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with ample white space to avoid overwhelming users with information. Prioritize readability and ease of navigation in both light and dark modes.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as highlighting correct answers or indicating progress. Ensure animations are optimized for both light and dark modes to avoid contrast issues.
